<H1>App Part 1: Creating controls at runtime</H1>

<P>Example: app_one</P>
<IMG SRC="images/app_one.gif" ALT="[images/app_one.gif]" ALIGN="right">

<P>
I thought that since an example on creating controls on the fly, although usefull, would be quite pointless 
unless the application actually did something, so in this entry I will start the workings of a text editor 
and build upon it untill we reach a nearly useful program that supports opening, editing and saving text 
documents.

<P>
The first step, which this particular page covers will be simply creating the window and the EDIT control
that will serve as the center of our program.

<P>
Starting with the skeleton code from the Simple Window application we add a <CODE>#define</CODE> as our control
ID and the following two message handlers into our window procedure:

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
#define IDC_MAIN_EDIT	101
</PRE>

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    case WM_CREATE:
    {
        HFONT hfDefault;
        HWND hEdit;

        hEdit = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, "EDIT", "", 
            WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_VSCROLL | WS_HSCROLL | ES_MULTILINE | ES_AUTOVSCROLL | ES_AUTOHSCROLL, 
            0, 0, 100, 100, hwnd, (HMENU)IDC_MAIN_EDIT, GetModuleHandle(NULL), NULL);
        if(hEdit == NULL)
            MessageBox(hwnd, "Could not create edit box.", "Error", MB_OK | MB_ICONERROR);

        hfDefault = GetStockObject(DEFAULT_GUI_FONT);
        SendMessage(hEdit, WM_SETFONT, (WPARAM)hfDefault, MAKELPARAM(FALSE, 0));
    }
    break;
    case WM_SIZE:
    {
        HWND hEdit;
        RECT rcClient;

        GetClientRect(hwnd, &rcClient);

        hEdit = GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MAIN_EDIT);
        SetWindowPos(hEdit, NULL, 0, 0, rcClient.right, rcClient.bottom, SWP_NOZORDER);
    }
    break;
</PRE>

<H3>Creating controls</H3>

Creating controls, like creating any other window, is done through the <CODE>CreateWindowEx()</CODE> API.  We
pass in pre-registered class that we want, in this case the "EDIT" control class, and we get a standard edit
control window.  When using dialogs to create our controls, we are basically writing a list of controls to create
so that then you call <CODE>DialogBox()</CODE> or <CODE>CreateDialog()</CODE> the system reads through the list
of controls in the dialog resource and calls <CODE>CreateWindowEx()</CODE> for each one with the position and 
styles that were defined in the resource.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    hEdit = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE, "EDIT", "", 
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_VSCROLL | WS_HSCROLL | ES_MULTILINE | ES_AUTOVSCROLL | ES_AUTOHSCROLL, 
        0, 0, 100, 100, hwnd, (HMENU)IDC_MAIN_EDIT, GetModuleHandle(NULL), NULL);
    if(hEdit == NULL)
        MessageBox(hwnd, "Could not create edit box.", "Error", MB_OK | MB_ICONERROR);
</PRE>

You can see that this call to <CODE>CreateWindowEx()</CODE> specifies quite a few styles, and it's not uncommon
to have many more, especially for the Common Controls which have a hearty list of options.  The first 4 <CODE>WS_</CODE>
styles should be fairly obvious, we are creating the control as a child of our window, we want it to be visible, and
have vertical and horizontal scroll bars.  

<P>
The 3 styles that are specific to EDIT controls (<CODE>ES_MULTILINE | ES_AUTOVSCROLL | ES_AUTOHSCROLL</CODE>) specify
that the EDIT control should contain multiple lines of text, and scroll automatically as you type beyond the bottom and 
right hand side of the control respectively.

<P>
The regular window styles (<CODE>WS_*</CODE>) are 
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/windows_2v90.asp">listed  here</A>.
And the extended windows styles (<CODE>WS_EX_*</CODE>) are explained under the 
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/windows_1w6w.asp"><CODE>CreateWindowEx()</CODE></A> 
reference in MSDN, where you can also find links to the styles that are specific to each control 
(<CODE>ES_*</CODE> in our case of the edit control).

<P>
We have specified our window handle as the parent of the control, and assigned it an ID of <CODE>IDC_MAIN_EDIT</CODE> which
we'll use later on to refer to the control just as you would if the control had been created on a dialog.  The position
and size parameters don't mean too much at the moment since we will be resizing the control dynamically in the <CODE>WM_SIZE</CODE>
message so that it will always fit our window.

<H3>Sizing of dynamically created controls</H3>

Generally if your window is sizeable you'll want some code to resize or reposition the controls you created within it
so that they are always layed out properly.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    GetClientRect(hwnd, &rcClient);

    hEdit = GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MAIN_EDIT);
    SetWindowPos(hEdit, NULL, 0, 0, rcClient.right, rcClient.bottom, SWP_NOZORDER);
</PRE>

<P>
Since we only have one control for now, the task is relatively simple.  We use <CODE>GetClientRect()</CODE> to get the dimentions
of the Client Area of the window, the big (up untill now) blank area that does not include the borders, menu or caption.  This
will fill in our <CODE>RECT</CODE> structure with the value, the <CODE>left</CODE> and <CODE>top</CODE> values will always
be 0, so you can usually just ignore them.  The <CODE>right</CODE> and <CODE>bottom</CODE> values will give you the width and the
hight of the client area.

<P>
Next we simply get a handle to our edit control using <CODE>GetDlgItem()</CODE> which works just as well on regular windows as
it does on dialogs, and the call <CODE>SetWindowPos()</CODE> to move and size it to fill the entire client area.  You can of course
change the values you pass into <CODE>SetWindowPos()</CODE> to do something like only fill half of the window's height, leaving
the bottom free to place other controls.

<H3>Creating other controls at runtime</H3>

I'm not going to give examples of dynamically creating the other controls like LISTBOX, BUTTON, etc... because it's basically
the same and it gets kinda boring after a while :)  If you follow the links into MSDN above, or look in your local Win32 API reference
you will be able to find all of the information needed to create any of the other standard controls.

<P>
We'll be doing more of this with the common controls in the next couple of sections so you'll get more practice eventually.
