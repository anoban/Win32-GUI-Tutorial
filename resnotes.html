<H1>Resource file notes</H1>

<H2>Argh!</H2>

The one thing I really hated when I switched my primary development environment from Borland C++ to MS Visual C++
was the way VC++ handles resource scripts (.rc files).

<P>
In BC++ was free to control the layout and content of the .rc files, and when using the resource editor, only 
the things that I specifically changed in the editor got changed in the resource file.  Much to my dismay, the 
VC++ resource editor will completely rewrite your .rc file, and possibly destroy or ignore any changes that 
you personally make.  

<P>
This was terribly frustrating at first, but I basically learned to deal with it and it's 
not SO bad after a while, since in general I don't write any amount of my resources by hand, but reserve that for
minor changes that perhaps I can't quite accomplish in the editor.

<H2>Compatibility</H2>

One small challange for this tutorial was to make the resource files compile properly under VC++ and BC++ without 
changes.  In the original tutorial I used the Borland naming convention for the resource header, which was 
<CODE>project_name.rh</CODE>.  However by default in VC++ this header is ALWAYS called <CODE>resource.h</CODE>,
so for simplicity I've adopted this for the current tutorial revision, as it doesn't impact BC++ at all. 

<P>
For the curious, it is possible to change the name of the resource that VC++ uses by editing the .rc file manually
and changing the name in two places, once where it is <CODE>#include</CODE>d, and second where it is contained in a 
<CODE>TEXTINCLUDE</CODE> resource.

<P>
The next problem is that by default VC++ requires the file <CODE>afxres.h</CODE> to be included in it's .rc files,
whereas BC++ has all the necessary preprocessor macros defined automatically and requires no such include.  Another
dumb thing about this is that <CODE>afxres.h</CODE> is only installed when you insall MFC which not everyone does,
even when you are creating an API application which only requires <CODE>winres.h</CODE> which is always installed.

<P>
Since I work in VC++ and use it's resource editor I've solved this problem by slightly altering each .rc file that
is generated to include the following:

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
#ifndef __BORLANDC__
#include "winres.h"
#endif
</PRE>

Which under default circumstances would usually read:

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
#include "afxres.h"
</PRE>

For those of you that are using VC++ you can find the option to change this text within the IDE under 
"View > Resource Includes".  There is generally no need to ever use this in normal practice, it's simply
a way I used to work around the problem of making things work with BC++ and VC++.

<P>
To those of you using BC++, I'm sorry about the extra mess in the .rc files that are generate by the VC++ editor, but
it shouldn't interfere with anything.

<H2>Compiling resources under BC++</H2>

Try as I might I couldn't find a simple way to compile a program with BC++ that included RC files, and ultimately had
to settle on the non-optimal configuration that you will find in the makefiles included with the source for this tutorial.
You can find the notes for the BC++ compiler in <A HREF="bcpp.html">Free Borland C++ Command Line Tools<A>.
