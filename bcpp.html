<H1>Free Borland C++ Command Line Tools</H1>

<H2>Getting Them</H2>

Fortunately for anyone that wants to get into windows developement, Borland has offered its
command line tools to the general public for FREE.  Isn't that nice of them?  There is
no pretty IDE or resource editor, but beggers can't be choosers, and I'd have to say
the compiler itself is of far better quality than either LCC-Win32 (which doesn't even do C++)
or the various ports of other tools, gcc, mingw, cygwin, djgpp etc...

<P>
<B>Read the readme to get yourself set up.</B>

<P>
What's extra spiffy is it even comes with a debugger!  I don't use this, so I can't offer
much help on it, but it's better than nothing.  And if you're used to Turbo C++ from the
DOS days, then this should be right up your ally.

<P>
For some reason Internet Explorer seems to have a problem with downloading this file,
so if it clicking the link doesn't work, right click and Copy Shortcut, and then use your
favourite FTP client to get it.

Last but not least, a windows help file with <B>full Win32 API reference</B>.
It's a few years old but still entirely accurate and much more convenient than MSDN online 
unless you need access to the most recent additions to the API (which if you're on this 
page, you don't).  I use it regularly.

<H2>Using Them</H2>

<H3>Basic commands</H3>

If you want to compile a single file program (simple_window.c for example), then you can use
the following command:

<PRE CLASS="CONSOLE">
bcc32 -tW simple_window.c
</PRE>

The <B>-tW</B> switch specifies a Win32 GUI application, instead of the default console
application.  You can compile multiple files into a single .exe by adding the other files to 
the end of this command.

<H3>Linking in Resources</H3>
This is a very frustrating issue for many users of the command line tools, and no wonder, since
it seems borland tried to make it as hard as possible to link resources into your applications,
the resource compiler <CODE>brc32</CODE> no longer behaves as it did in earlier versions of the program
where it would link the compiled resource into the .exe itself.  When you run <B>brc32</B> with
no option to get the usage help, it still lists an option to turn .exe linking <I>OFF</I>, there 
simply appears to be no way to turn it <I>ON</I>.

<P>
I tried various combinations of command and options, but couldn't find any way to add a .res 
file to an .exe build with the above method.   Which really sucks, cause the way I found to do
it is a lot more complicated.  

<P>
<B>There is an easier way however...</B>

<P>
BC++ now has an alternative method of including resources in a program by use of a <CODE>#pragma</CODE> (a non-standard
preprocessor directive that compilers will ignore if they don't recognise it).

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
#pragma resource "app_name.res"
</PRE>

Placing this code in your main .c or .cpp file will cause the compiler to automatically link in the .res file that
is generated from your .rc (.res is like an .obj file for resources).

<P>
Using the #pragma will allow you to compile programs nearly as simply as above, but you still need to compile
the .rc file first using brc32.  If you still want to use command line options as I did in the tutorial
makefiles, read on...

<P>
<B>The hard way...</B>
<P>
These are the commands to use to compile the dlg_one example, including the resource.

<PRE CLASS="CONSOLE">
bcc32 -c -tW dlg_one.c
ilink32 -aa -c -x -Gn dlg_one.obj c0w32.obj,dlg_one.exe,,import32.lib cw32.lib,,dlg_one.res
</PRE>

Nice eh?  The <B>-c</B> option to <B>bcc32</B> means compile only, don't link into an .exe.
The <B>-x -Gn</B> options get rid of some extra files the linker creates that you probably 
don't need.  

<P>
The real bugger with this is that since we are manually specifying the linker command, we need
to include the default libraries and objs that the compiler would normally do for us.  As you 
can see above, I've specified the appropriate files for a regular windows application.

<P>
To make things easier on yourself, it's best to do all this in a makefile.  I've prepared a 
generic one that should work with all of the examples in the tutorial, and you should be 
able to adapt it to any of your own programs.

<PRE CLASS="LIST">
APP      = dlg_one
EXEFILE  = $(APP).exe
OBJFILES = $(APP).obj 
RESFILES = $(APP).res
LIBFILES =
DEFFILE  =

.AUTODEPEND
BCC32   = bcc32
ILINK32 = ilink32
BRC32   = brc32

CFLAGS  = -c -tWM- -w -w-par -w-inl -W -a1 -Od
LFLAGS  = -aa -V4.0 -c -x -Gn
RFLAGS  = -X -R 
STDOBJS = c0w32.obj
STDLIBS = import32.lib cw32.lib

$(EXEFILE) : $(OBJFILES) $(RESFILES)
   $(ILINK32) $(LFLAGS) $(OBJFILES) $(STDOBJS), $(EXEFILE), , \
      $(LIBFILES) $(STDLIBS), $(DEFFILE), $(RESFILES)

clean:
   del *.obj *.res *.tds *.map
</PRE>

You only need to modify the first 6 lines with the appropriate information.
