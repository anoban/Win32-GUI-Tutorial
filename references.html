If you expect anyone online to treat you with respect while you are learning, you NEED to 
get a good book to learn from.  We're here to provide direction and explain things that need
explaining, not to be your librarian or teach you step by step.

<P>
You can find more recommended books and links to buy at the <A HREF="http://winprog.org/shop/">#Winprog Store</A>.
