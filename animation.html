<H1>Timers and Animation</H1>

<P>Example: anim_one</P>
<IMG SRC="images/anim_one.gif" ALT="[images/anim_one.gif]" ALIGN="right">

<H2>Setting up</H2>

Before we get things animated, we need to set up a structure to store the position of
the ball between updates.  This struct will store the current position and size of the ball,
as well as the delta values, how much we want it to move each frame.

<P>
Once we have the structure type declared, we also declare a global instance of the struct.  This
is ok since we only have one ball, if were were going to animate a bunch of them, you'd probably want
to use an array or other container (such as a linked list in C++) to store them in a more convenient
way.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
const int BALL_MOVE_DELTA = 2;

typedef struct _BALLINFO 
{
    int width;
    int height;
    int x;
    int y;

    int dx;
    int dy;
}BALLINFO;

BALLINFO g_ballInfo;
</PRE>

We've also defined a constant <CODE>BALL_MOVE_DELTA</CODE> which is how far we want the ball to move on
each update.  The reason we store deltas in the <CODE>BALLINFO</CODE> structure as well is that we want
to be able to move the ball left or right and up and down independantly, <CODE>BALL_MOVE_DELTA</CODE>
is just a handy name to give the value so we can change it later if we want.

<P>
Now we need to initialize this structure after we load our bitmaps:

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    BITMAP bm;
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    GetObject(g_hbmBall, sizeof(bm), &bm);

    ZeroMemory(&g_ballInfo, sizeof(g_ballInfo));
    g_ballInfo.width = bm.bmWidth;
    g_ballInfo.height = bm.bmHeight;

    g_ballInfo.dx = BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
    g_ballInfo.dy = BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
</PRE>

<P>
The ball starts off in the top left corner, moving to the right and down according to the <CODE>dx</CODE> and <CODE>dy</CODE> members 
of <CODE>BALLINFO</CODE>.

<H2>Setting the Timer</H2>

The easiest way to add a simple timer into a window program is with <CODE>SetTimer()</CODE>, it's not the best, and it's
not recommended for real multimedia or full games, however it's good enough for simple animations like this.  When you 
need something better take a look at <CODE>timeSetEvent()</CODE> in MSDN; it's more accurate.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
const int ID_TIMER = 1;
</PRE>
<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    ret = SetTimer(hwnd, ID_TIMER, 50, NULL);
    if(ret == 0)
        MessageBox(hwnd, "Could not SetTimer()!", "Error", MB_OK | MB_ICONEXCLAMATION);
</PRE>

Here we've declared a timer id so that we can refer to it later (to kill it) and then set the timer
in the <CODE>WM_CREATE</CODE> handler of our main window.  Each time the timer elapses, it will send
a <CODE>WM_TIMER</CODE> message to the window, and pass us back the ID in <CODE>wParam</CODE>.  
Since we only have one timer we don't need the ID, but it's useful if you set more than one timer
and need to tell them apart.

<P>
We've set the timer to elapse every 50 milliseconds, which results in approximately 20 frames per second.  Approximately
because like I said, <CODE>SetTimer()</CODE> is a little inaccurate, but this isn't critical code, and a few milliseconds
here or there won't kill us.

<H2>Animating in WM_TIMER</H2>

Now when we get <CODE>WM_TIMER</CODE> we want to calculate the new position for the ball and draw it's updated
position.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    case WM_TIMER:
    {
        RECT rcClient;
        HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);

        GetClientRect(hwnd, &rcClient);

        UpdateBall(&rcClient);
        DrawBall(hdc, &rcClient);

        ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc);
    }
    break;
</PRE>

<P>
I've put the code for updating and drawing the ball in their own functions.  This is good practice, and
it lets us draw the ball from either <CODE>WM_TIMER</CODE> or <CODE>WM_PAINT</CODE> without duplicating code, note that the method
we use to get the <CODE>HDC</CODE> in each case is different, so it's best to leave this code in the message handlers
and pass the result into the <CODE>DrawBall()</CODE> function.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
void UpdateBall(RECT* prc)
{
    g_ballInfo.x += g_ballInfo.dx;
    g_ballInfo.y += g_ballInfo.dy;

    if(g_ballInfo.x < 0)
    {
        g_ballInfo.x = 0;
        g_ballInfo.dx = BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
    }
    else if(g_ballInfo.x + g_ballInfo.width > prc->right)
    {
        g_ballInfo.x = prc->right - g_ballInfo.width;
        g_ballInfo.dx = -BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
    }

    if(g_ballInfo.y < 0)
    {
        g_ballInfo.y = 0;
        g_ballInfo.dy = BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
    }
    else if(g_ballInfo.y + g_ballInfo.height > prc->bottom)
    {
        g_ballInfo.y = prc->bottom - g_ballInfo.height;
        g_ballInfo.dy = -BALL_MOVE_DELTA;
    }
}
</PRE>

All this does is some basic math, we add the delta value to the x position to move the ball.  If the ball goes
outside the client area, move it back in range and change the delta value to the opposite direction so that the
ball "bounces" off the sides.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
void DrawBall(HDC hdc, RECT* prc)
{
    HDC hdcBuffer = CreateCompatibleDC(hdc);
    HBITMAP hbmBuffer = CreateCompatibleBitmap(hdc, prc->right, prc->bottom);
    HBITMAP hbmOldBuffer = SelectObject(hdcBuffer, hbmBuffer);

    HDC hdcMem = CreateCompatibleDC(hdc);
    HBITMAP hbmOld = SelectObject(hdcMem, g_hbmMask);

    FillRect(hdcBuffer, prc, GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH));

    BitBlt(hdcBuffer, g_ballInfo.x, g_ballInfo.y, g_ballInfo.width, g_ballInfo.height, hdcMem, 0, 0, SRCAND);

    SelectObject(hdcMem, g_hbmBall);
    BitBlt(hdcBuffer, g_ballInfo.x, g_ballInfo.y, g_ballInfo.width, g_ballInfo.height, hdcMem, 0, 0, SRCPAINT);

    BitBlt(hdc, 0, 0, prc->right, prc->bottom, hdcBuffer, 0, 0, SRCCOPY);

    SelectObject(hdcMem, hbmOld);
    DeleteDC(hdcMem);

    SelectObject(hdcBuffer, hbmOldBuffer);
    DeleteDC(hdcBuffer);
    DeleteObject(hbmBuffer);
}
</PRE>

This is essentially the same drawing code as the past few examples, with the exception that it gets the 
position and dimentions of the ball from the <CODE>BALLINFO</CODE> structure.  There is however one important difference...

<H2>Double Buffering</H2>

When doing your drawing directly to the <CODE>HDC</CODE> of the window, it's entirely possible that the screen
will get updated before you're done... for example after you draw the mask and before you draw the colour image
over top, the user might see a flicker of the back background before your program has a chance to draw over it
in colour.  The slower your computer and the more drawing operations that you do, the more flicker will be apparent
and eventually it will look like a big jumbled mess.

<P>
This is terribly distracting, and we can solve it simply by doing all the drawing in memory first, and then
copying the completed masterpiece to the screen in a single <CODE>BitBlt()</CODE> so that the screen is updated
directly from the old image, to the complete new image with none of the individual operations visible.

<P>
To do this, we create a temporary <CODE>HBITMAP</CODE> in memory that is the exact size of the area we are going to 
draw to on the screen.  We also need an <CODE>HDC</CODE> so that we can <CODE>BitBlt()</CODE> to the bitmap.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    HDC hdcBuffer = CreateCompatibleDC(hdc);
    HBITMAP hbmBuffer = CreateCompatibleBitmap(hdc, prc->right, prc->bottom);
    HBITMAP hbmOldBuffer = SelectObject(hdcBuffer, hbmBuffer);
</PRE>

Now that we have a place to draw to in memory, all of the drawing operations use <CODE>hdcBuffer</CODE> instead of 
<CODE>hdc</CODE> (the window) and the results are stored on the bitmap in memory untill we are complete.  We can now
copy the whole thing over to the window in one shot.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    BitBlt(hdc, 0, 0, prc->right, prc->bottom, hdcBuffer, 0, 0, SRCCOPY);
</PRE>

That's it, and we clean up our <CODE>HDC</CODE>s and <CODE>HBITMAP</CODE>s as usual.

<H3>Faster Double Buffering</H3>

In this example I am creating and destroying the bitmap used for double buffering each frame, I did this basically
because I wanted to be able to size the window so it's easier to just always create a new buffer than to track
when the window position changes and resize the buffer.  It would be more efficient to create a global double 
buffer bitmap and either not allow the window to resize or only resize the bitmap when the window resized, instead
of creating it and destroying it all the time.  It's up to you to implement this if you want to optimize the drawing
for a game or something.

<H2>Killing the Timer</H2>

When our window is destroyed, it's a good idea to release all resources we used, and in this case that
includes the timer we set.  To stop it, we simply call <CODE>KillTimer()</CODE> and pass in the ID that we used when
we created it.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    KillTimer(hwnd, ID_TIMER);
</PRE>
