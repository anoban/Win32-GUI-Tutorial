<H1>App Part 3: Tool and Status bars</H1>

<P>Example: app_three</P>
<IMG SRC="images/app_three.gif" ALT="[images/app_three.gif]" ALIGN="right">

<H3>An IMPORTANT Word on Common Controls</H3>

<P>
As with all common controls, you must call <CODE>InitCommonControls()</CODE>
<I>BEFORE</I> you try and use them.  You will need to <CODE>#include &lt;commctrl.h&gt;</CODE>
in order to use this function and to get the functions and declarations necessary for
use of the Common Controls.  You will also need to add <CODE>comctl32.lib</CODE>
to your linker settings if it is not already there.  Note that <CODE>InitCommonControls()</CODE>
is an older API, and for more control you can use <CODE>InitCommonControlsEx()</CODE> 
(aka <I>InitCommonControlSex()</I>) which is also required for the most recent common controls.  However
since I'm not using any of the advanced features, <CODE>InitCommonControls()</CODE> is adequate
and simpler.

<H2>Toolbars</H2>

<P>
You can create a toolbar using <CODE>CreateToolbarEx()</CODE> but I'm not going
to, so there.  First thing you need to do is actually create the toolbar...

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    hTool = CreateWindowEx(0, TOOLBARCLASSNAME, NULL, WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hwnd, (HMENU)IDC_MAIN_TOOL, GetModuleHandle(NULL), NULL);
</PRE>

<P>
That's simple enough, <CODE>TOOLBARCLASSNAME</CODE> is a constant defined by the
common control headers. <CODE>hwnd</CODE> is the parent window, the one you
want to put the toolbar in.  <CODE>IDC_MAIN_TOOL</CODE> is an identifier that you can
use later to get the <CODE>HWND</CODE> of the toolbar using <CODE>GetDlgItem()</CODE>,
if you so desire.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
     // Send the TB_BUTTONSTRUCTSIZE message, which is required for
     // backward compatibility.
     SendMessage(hTool, TB_BUTTONSTRUCTSIZE, (WPARAM)sizeof(TBBUTTON), 0);
</PRE>

<P>
This message is required to let the system figure out which version of the common controls library 
you are using.  Since new versions add new stuff to the structure, by giving it the size it can figure
out what behaviour you are expecting.

<H3>Toolbar buttons</H3>

Button bitmaps on basic toolbars come in two varieties, standard buttons that are provided by comctl32, and
user defined buttons that you create yourself.

<B>NOTE:</B> Buttons and bitmaps are added to toolbars seperately... first you add a list of images
to use, and THEN you add a list of buttons, and telling it which button uses which image.

<H3>Adding Standard Buttons</H3>

Now that we have a toolbar created, we need to add some buttons to it.  The most common bitmaps
are available in the common control library itself, so we don't need to recreate them or 
add them to every exe that uses them.

<P>
First we declare a <CODE>TBBUTTON</CODE> and <CODE>TBADDBITMAP</CODE>

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    TBBUTTON tbb[3];
    TBADDBITMAP tbab;
</PRE>

And then we add the standard bitmaps to the toolbar, using the imagelist predefined in 
the common control library...

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    tbab.hInst = HINST_COMMCTRL;
    tbab.nID = IDB_STD_SMALL_COLOR;
    SendMessage(hTool, TB_ADDBITMAP, 0, (LPARAM)&tbab);
</PRE>

Now that we have our images loaded up, we can add some buttons that use them...

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    ZeroMemory(tbb, sizeof(tbb));
    tbb[0].iBitmap = STD_FILENEW;
    tbb[0].fsState = TBSTATE_ENABLED;
    tbb[0].fsStyle = TBSTYLE_BUTTON;
    tbb[0].idCommand = ID_FILE_NEW;

    tbb[1].iBitmap = STD_FILEOPEN;
    tbb[1].fsState = TBSTATE_ENABLED;
    tbb[1].fsStyle = TBSTYLE_BUTTON;
    tbb[1].idCommand = ID_FILE_OPEN;

    tbb[2].iBitmap = STD_FILESAVE;
    tbb[2].fsState = TBSTATE_ENABLED;
    tbb[2].fsStyle = TBSTYLE_BUTTON;
    tbb[2].idCommand = ID_FILE_SAVEAS;

    SendMessage(hTool, TB_ADDBUTTONS, sizeof(tbb)/sizeof(TBBUTTON), (LPARAM)&tbb);
</PRE>

Here we've added a New, Open and Save As button using the standard images, which is always
a good idea since people are used to seeing them and they know what they mean.

<P>
The indexes of each image in the imagelist are defined in the common control headers and are
listed in MSDN.

<P>
We have assigned each button an ID (<CODE>ID_FILE_NEW</CODE> etc...) which is identical to the IDs of the
equivalent menu items.  These buttons will generate <CODE>WM_COMMAND</CODE> messages identical to the menu,
so no extra processing is required!  If we were adding a button for a command that didn't already
have a menu item, we would simply pick a new ID for it and add a handler to <CODE>WM_COMMAND</CODE>.

<P>
If you're wondering what's up with the funky <CODE>wParam</CODE> I passed to <CODE>TB_ADDBUTTONS</CODE>
it's doing a calculation of the number of buttons in the array tbb so that we don't need to
hardcode a value.  If I put in 3 instead it would still be correct, but as soon as I added another
button I'd have to change it to 4 and in programming that's bad... you want one change to cause
as few other changes as possible.  For example if the <CODE>sizeof(TBBUTTON)</CODE> was 16 bytes
(I made that up, it actually varies by platform) then since we have 3 buttons the <CODE>sizeof(tbb)</CODE>
would be 16 * 3 or 48.  Therefor 48/16 gives us the number of buttons, 3.

<H2>Status bars</H2>

Something often found in apps with toolbars are status bars, the little things at the bottom of
the window that display information.  They're pretty simple to use, just create...

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    hStatus = CreateWindowEx(0, STATUSCLASSNAME, NULL,
        WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | SBARS_SIZEGRIP, 0, 0, 0, 0,
        hwnd, (HMENU)IDC_MAIN_STATUS, GetModuleHandle(NULL), NULL);
</PRE>

And then (optionally) set the number of sections that you want.  If you don't set any,
it will simply have one section using the entire width of the bar, and you can set and retreive
the text with <CODE>SetWindowText()</CODE> as with many other controls.  For more than one
part, you need to give the widths of each section, and then use <CODE>SB_SETTEXT</CODE> to
set the text of each one.

<P>
To define the widths, we declare an array of <CODE>int</CODE>s, where each value is the
width in pixels of a section.  If you want one section to use up any remaining space, set
it's width to <CODE>-1</CODE>.

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    int statwidths[] = {100, -1};

    SendMessage(hStatus, SB_SETPARTS, sizeof(statwidths)/sizeof(int), (LPARAM)statwidths);
    SendMessage(hStatus, SB_SETTEXT, 0, (LPARAM)"Hi there :)");
</PRE>

<P>
The wParam again is our calculation of how many elements are in the array.  Once we're done 
adding sections, we set the first one (index <CODE>0</CODE>) to see it in action.

<H2>Proper Sizing</H2>

Unlike menus, tool and status bars are seperate controls that live inside the parent window's 
client area.  Therefor if we just leave our <CODE>WM_SIZE</CODE> code from before, they are going to overlap 
with the edit control we added in the previous examples.  This is a simple matter to correct...
in <CODE>WM_SIZE</CODE>, we move the tool and status bars into position, and then subtract their
heights and positions from the client area so that we can move our edit control to fill the remaining
space...

<PRE CLASS="SNIP">
    HWND hTool;
    RECT rcTool;
    int iToolHeight;

    HWND hStatus;
    RECT rcStatus;
    int iStatusHeight;

    HWND hEdit;
    int iEditHeight;
    RECT rcClient;

    // Size toolbar and get height

    hTool = GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MAIN_TOOL);
    SendMessage(hTool, TB_AUTOSIZE, 0, 0);

    GetWindowRect(hTool, &rcTool);
    iToolHeight = rcTool.bottom - rcTool.top;

    // Size status bar and get height

    hStatus = GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MAIN_STATUS);
    SendMessage(hStatus, WM_SIZE, 0, 0);

    GetWindowRect(hStatus, &rcStatus);
    iStatusHeight = rcStatus.bottom - rcStatus.top;

    // Calculate remaining height and size edit

    GetClientRect(hwnd, &rcClient);

    iEditHeight = rcClient.bottom - iToolHeight - iStatusHeight;

    hEdit = GetDlgItem(hwnd, IDC_MAIN_EDIT);
    SetWindowPos(hEdit, NULL, 0, iToolHeight, rcClient.right, iEditHeight, SWP_NOZORDER);
</PRE>

<P>
Unfortunately it's a somewhat long code snippet, but it's quite simple... toolbars will
auto position themselves when sent the <CODE>TB_AUTOSIZE</CODE> message, and status bars will do the
same if you send them <CODE>WM_SIZE</CODE> (the common control libraries are not known for consistancy).
